Our school organized a RoboMaster team and plans to attend the competition this year. Since we are all new students at a new campus, we do not have any reference materials available from previous students, and we have to figure out bugs after bugs on our own.

This article describes some of the problems we met during software development.

> Hardware: RoboMaster Official Development Board
> MCU Model: STM32F427IIHx
> Software: ChibiOS 18.2.0

Board Has 12 MHz HSE Clock Instead of Commonly Seen 8MHz
--------------------------------------------------------

The pitfall is that neither of the manual or the hardware schematics mentioned the clock frequence.

Due to this problem, the actual frequency we programatically set with STM32CubeMX or other software is much higher than expected. This caused the following problems:

- Mysterious failure in setting frequency (Board unresponsive after setting a core frequency well below maximum, had to short a resistor to recover)
- USART timing error (Receiving / sending garbage despite same baudrate / format, unable to use the remote controller)
- Cannot respond to CAN data (Both board and motors are sending CAN frames, and the oscilloscope can decode them, but neither the board or the motor ACKs successful transmission)

All of the problems are solved by readjusting the clock frequency.

Delay Required Sending CAN Frames in `while(true);` Loop
--------------------------------------------------------

This is kinda a minor problem. During CAN communication all devices are connected to the same bus, and only one device can send data simultaneously. If you are sending frames in a `while(true);` loop without delay, other devices will not have a chance to send out messages, and naturally the development board cannot respond to them.

A simple addition of `chThdSleepMilliseconds(100);` solves the problem.

CAN and USB Cannot be Used Simultaneously on Our STM32
------------------------------------------------------

The UART port on the development board is some kind of connector instead of bare pins, and we don't have wires for it, so we tried to use the Serial over USB feature of ChibiOS, or emulating a serial port over USB connection, for debugging.

After testing and searching for information for 2 hours without success, we finally found out that CAN and USB cannot be enabled simultaneously on this specific STM32 board.

However CAN is necessary for us, since we need it to talk to the motors. Therefore... we reverted back to debugging with blinking LEDs.

`while(true);` in Main Thread Blocks Execution of Sub Threads
-------------------------------------------------------------

My teammate wrote the main logic (checking button status and driving motors) in another thread, and the main thread is expected to do nothing with `while(true);` after initializing everything. Later he found out that the other thread should have a priority of at least (2 + normal priority), or it wouldn't run.

After a quick investigation, I concluded that ChibiOS sets the priority of main thread to (1 + normal priority). `while(true);` is still some code consuming CPU cycles, and it blocks other threads with same or lower priority. The solution is `while(true) chThdSleepMilliseconds(1000);`, which tells the main thread to sleep and ChibiOS to schedule other tasks.

Key Sequence Error in DJI Documentation
---------------------------------------

The status of 4 keys (Q, E, Shift and Ctrl) are sent as 4 bits to the development board with one-to-one correspondence. The document states that the order from high bit to low bit is Q, E, Shift and Ctrl, but actual test shows that it is Ctrl, Shift, E and Q.

(Almost hit by the robot)

Weird Data Type Conversion
--------------------------

My teammate wrote code for PID adjustment of chassis motors, but the motors will always accelerate to full "reverse" speed once they are turned on, no matter what direction they are supposed to be running.

After 2 hours of debugging, I found out that my teammate has written the following code:

```c
uint8_t x = 0xff; // Example response data from motor,
uint8_t y = 0x8f; // splitted to 2 uint8_t's
int a = (x << 8 | y); // What my teammate has done
```

The int here is int32_t.

What we expect to get is 0xffffff8f, or -113; but while executing the code above, C pads 0 to the beginning of a, and the result is 0x0000ff8f, or 65423. Therefore, PID thinks the motor is running at tremendous "forward" speed, and behaves weirdly.

C does this since a 4 byte variable is generated at statement `x << 8`:

```c
int c = sizeof(x << 8); // c = 4
```

And the actual operand of the OR operation is 0x0000ff00 and 0x8fï¼Œresulting in 0x0000ff8f.

On the other hand, such phenomenon will not occur with uint16_t's:

```c
uint16_t x = 0xffff;
uint16_t y = 0xff8f;
int64_t a = (x << 16 | y); // a = -113
```

Since x << 16 = 0xffff0000, a = 0xffffff8f = -113.

For the original problem, the solution is replacing int to int16_t:

```c
int16_t a = (x << 8 | y);
```

This time a = 0xff8f, or -113, which meets expectations.

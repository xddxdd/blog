With the scale of conflict between China and the United States increasing, on some social media websites in China, some users started expressing concerns on United States cutting China's access to DNS root servers, or removing China's domains in the root servers, in order to break China's Internet.

By now, there are many analysis on the matter that states that this is unlikely to happen. Most of them focus on the following two points:

- DNS root servers use Anycast to broadcast their IPs, and there are root servers present in China that won't be affected by the network cut;
- For the United States, shutting down root servers cause more trouble than benefit, both economically and politically.

Yet today I'm going to present another point:

- You can set up your own DNS root server and make your recursive DNS servers use it, in a short time.

Yes. The root server you're going to selfhost is functionally equivalent to the root servers as fundamental Internet infrastructure.

DNS Resolving Process
---------------------

First, let's take a look at the procedures of DNS resolve:

1. You turned on your computer, entered `https://www.lantian.pub` in order to visit my blog.
   - Although my blog doesn't have `www` in its URL, for demonstration purposes let's temporarily assume that it has one.
2. Your browser cannot directly talk to the domain. It needs to know the IP address associated to the domain. Therefore, your browser sends a DNS request to a "recursive DNS resolver" configured in your operating system, like `8.8.8.8`.
   - The DNS request will contain: request the DNS server to **perform recursion**, and return the **A record** (or IPv4 address) associated with `www.lantian.pub`.
   - The IP address of the recursive resolver is configured in OS beforehand, usually obtained from your router via DHCP, or you may have set it manually.
   - How do routers obtain DNS servers' IP addresses? They will also use DHCP, PPPoE, or similar protocols to obtain DNS servers from their upstream. The process goes through to your ISP (like China Telecom), where it sets up its own DNS server and configures the IP addresses in its core routers.
3. The recursive DNS resolver (or recursor) get the request and starts **recursion**.
   - Note the **recursion** here. Another type of DNS server is **authoritative DNS server** that doesn't perform recursion. This means that if you point the OS resolver address to a authoritative resolver, it's very unlikely that you can complete the DNS resolving process.
4. Recursor first asks the **DNS root server** if it knows the IP address of `www.lantian.pub`.
5. The root server looks up its database, and found that it doesn't know about it. But it does have NS records of `pub` domain, or the IP addresses of the authoritative resolver in charge of `pub`.
   - Then it replies: "You can ask authoritative servers of `pub`. Here are their IP addresses."
     - What gets replied is the NS records (or the domain of the authoritative resolver) of the `pub` domain, optionally with their A/AAAA records (IP addresses).
   - DNS root servers are not in charge of all domains in the universe. They only handle top level domains, like the NS records of `com`, `net`, `org`, etc, and tells recursors to ask another server.
   - DNS root servers **DO NOT** perform recursion!
6. Recursor then asks the authoritative server of `pub` about the IP address of `www.lantian.pub`.
7. The authoritative server of `pub` looks up its database and replies: "No, but you can ask this server (along with `lantian.pub`'s NS records, and optionally A/AAAA records)"
8. Recursor then asks `lantian.pub`'s authoritative server about `www.lantian.pub`.
9. The authoritative server of `lantian.pub` looks up its database and replies: "Yes I do! the IP address is this (along with `www.lantian.pub`'s A record"
10. Recursor finally gets the IP, and sends a reply to your browser about the IP.
11. Your browser got the IP address for the domain and initiates a TCP connection. What happens later isn't relevant to DNS anymore.

In short, DNS root servers are "guides" to recursors, about the authoritative servers they should ask for a domain suffix.

Although it looks like the root servers will be under a lot of pressure, it isn't the case. DNS servers (including recursors and authoritative servers) usually sends a Time-To-Live (TTL) with their replies, that tells browsers (clients) or recursors to simply use this result for the time period, and not annoy the server again.

Selfhosting DNS Root Server
---------------------------

In the previous steps, the DNS root server, the authoritative server of `pub` and that of `lantian.pub` do similar things: they receive a request and sends back a NS record or A/AAAA records. It seems that they can be backed by the same software. This is indeed the case.

Therefore with common authoritative DNS resolver software, like PowerDNS or Bind9, you can set up your own root server.

1. Install PowerDNS.

   ```bash
   apt install pdns-server pdns-backend-mysql
   ```

2. Modify PowerDNS's config, `/etc/powerdns/pdns.conf`. The key modifications are:

   ```bash
   # Enable Bind Backend, so PowerDNS can recognize DNS record data in Bind format
   # Bind is the de-facto standard format for DNS records
   launch=bind
   # Tell Bind Backend to load this config
   bind-config=/etc/powerdns/bind.conf
   # Check the config for updates every few moments (60 seconds)
   bind-check-interval=60
   # Ignore problematic records, so even if you made a mistake,
   # other normal records can still be served
   bind-ignore-broken-records=yes
   ```

3. Go to [IANA's official website](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/files), click on `Root Zone File` to download the root server's DNS record file. Save it to `/etc/powerdns/root.zone`.
   - Yes, this file of around 2 MB is all that's in charge of DNS root servers.
4. Open the downloaded `root.zone` file. The content within is seperated to 5 columns. Perform some modifications:
   - Remove all lines with a dot `.` in the 1st column, and `NS` in the 4th column.
     - These lines are at the beginning of the file.
   - Remove all lines where the content in 4th column is not `A`, `AAAA`, `SOA` or `NS`. This can be achieved with:

     ```bash
     cat root.zone | awk '{if ($4=="A" || $4=="AAAA" || $4=="SOA" || $4=="NS") print $0}' > root.zone.2
     ```

     What's removed is DNSSEC relevant, used to prevent DNS records from being modified. But since we do need to modify, these records will be invalid, so we'd better remove them all.

   - Add IP address of your own server. Assume your server's IP is `192.168.0.1` and `fd00::1`, with a domain `server.example.com` pointing to it, add these lines to the end of the file:

     ```bash
     # Comments in Bind DNS files start with semicolons,
     # so no lines starting with number (hashtag) signs.
     #
     # Remove all these comments while copying contents!
     #
     # Note the extra dot at the end of the line. IT MUST BE THERE.
     . 86400 IN NS server.example.com.
     # Also note the extra dot in 1st column. MUST BE THERE, TOO.
     server.example.com. 86400 IN A 192.168.0.1
     server.example.com. 86400 IN AAAA fd00::1
     # 86400 is TTL, the time period that the record is valid in cache.
     # Adjust if you need
     ```

     These records indicate that your server is "in charge" of the root zone records of DNS.

     If you have multiple servers you plan to set up as root servers, repeat the step a few times.

5. Create file `/etc/powerdns/bind.conf` and add these contents, so PowerDNS knows that the file above is in charge of the root DNS zone:

   ```bash
   zone "." { type native; file "/etc/powerdns/root.zone"; };
   ```

   That's correct, only one line.
6. `systemctl restart pdns` to restart the PowerDNS service.
7. Run `dig @192.168.0.1` to check if your records are properly loaded. Normally, the lines you added above should be shown. For example if you run `dig @103.42.215.193`, which is querying against my root server, you would see:

   ```bash
   ;; ANSWER SECTION:
   .                       3600    IN      NS      gigsgigscloud.lantian.pub.

   ;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
   gigsgigscloud.lantian.pub. 3600 IN      AAAA    2001:470:fa1c::1
   gigsgigscloud.lantian.pub. 3600 IN      A       103.42.215.193
   ```

   (Some lines removed tor brevity)
8. Then, run `dig @192.168.0.1 www.example.com`, and you should get an output similar to:

   ```bash
   ;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
   com.                    172800  IN      NS      m.gtld-servers.net.
   com.                    172800  IN      NS      l.gtld-servers.net.
   com.                    172800  IN      NS      k.gtld-servers.net.

   ;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
   m.gtld-servers.net.     172800  IN      AAAA    2001:501:b1f9::30
   m.gtld-servers.net.     172800  IN      A       192.55.83.30
   l.gtld-servers.net.     172800  IN      AAAA    2001:500:d937::30
   l.gtld-servers.net.     172800  IN      A       192.41.162.30
   k.gtld-servers.net.     172800  IN      AAAA    2001:503:d2d::30
   k.gtld-servers.net.     172800  IN      A       192.52.178.30
   ```

   This is your root server returning the authoritative server addresses of `com` domain, telling the recursor to go and ask these servers.

   (Again, some lines removed tor brevity)
9. Congratulations! You now have your own root server.

Using Your Roots for Recursion
------------------------------

With your root servers available, the next step is to configure your recursors to use them to complete the recursion process.

First, save all of the content you added above (or equivalent, the content of `dig @192.168.0.1`) to a file, ex. `root.hint`.

For PowerDNS Recursor software, if you haven't enabled DNSSEC validation, simply add this line in config file:

```bash
hint-file=/etc/powerdns/root.hint
```

The restart PowerDNS Recursor and it will work.

If you enabled DNSSEC, you need to tell PowerDNS Recursor not to validate contents in DNS root zones, since we removed all DNSSEC records above.

Add another line in the config file:

```bash
lua-config-file=/etc/powerdns/script.lua
```

And create the file `/etc/powerdns/script.lua` with this line:

```lua
addNTA(".")
```

Save and restart PowerDNS Recursor. Done.

Now test your own resolver, it should be able to resolve any address as you want, like `lantian.pub`, `bing.com`, etc.

If the Cut Actually Happened
----------------------------

Assume the United States did use technical means to cut the connection from all DNS root servers to China.

First, with the existence of caches, China's DNS resolving process won't be immediately shut down. Take a look at the `root.zone` file, most of the TTL (validity times) are 86400 (24 hours) or even more. This means that China has approximately 24 hours to respond.

In the 24 hours, with caches expiring, different recursors will gradually start to fail the recursion resolving process. By then, the resolver administrators will only need to set up a root server by above means, and modify recursor's configs to use it. Immediately things will be back to normal.

But This is Just a Toy, Right?
------------------------------

First, if the root server is for temporary emergency private use by one recursive DNS server, with the existence of caching, the load on root servers won't be too high. Open source DNS resolver software should already provide sufficient performance.

But if a authoritative DNS provider (Like DNSPod) wants to make the root server public, to help each other through the hard times, the server load will be much higher. But don't forget that professional DNS providers have professional solutions to maximize their peformance, and building a root server has no special requirements on the DNS server software itself. This means that they can quickly reuse their professional solution and set up a high performance root server cluster, to satisfy the public's needs.

Conclusion
----------

DNS root servers is not technically special. Apart from their special position, they are no different from other authoritative resolvers. If the currently used root servers are down, simply quickly configure and "promote" another cluster to replace them.

The process of configuration and "promotion" is not complicated either, using existing software to load existing data. Therefore, there's no need to worry about large impacts of shutting down DNS root servers.

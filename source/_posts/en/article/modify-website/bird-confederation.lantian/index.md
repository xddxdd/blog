Comparison of BGP Interconnection Schemes within an ISP
-------------------------------------------------------

Most ISPs, or Internet Service Providers, use BGP protocol to exchange their route information. Each ISP will obtain an ASN (Autonomous System Number) from the regional NIC (Network Information Center, e.g. APNIC, RIPE), for example China Telecom's ASN is 4134. Then, ISPs connect their boundary routers via physical links (copper line, fiber, satellite link, etc), and configure BGP protocol on the boundary routers, so they will tell the other part that: "I'm AS4134, and I can provide access to the IP block of `202.101.0.0/18`". Routers directly connected to China Telecom will proceed on repeating that message: "I'm ASxxxx, and I'm 1 step from the source of `202.101.0.0/18`". And it goes on. Routers of each ISP will then consider parameters, including distance to the target, and send packets to the best target that this router can reach.

(Note: The scenario above is simplified, and there are more complicated rules for ISP interconnection and best path selection in the real world.)

BGP can also be necessary within a large scale AS, for example China Telecom which operates a network across the entire Mainland China, and has its core routers in each city. Each core router is responsible for a small fraction of IP ranges China Telecom owns. To make the routers aware of the responsible one for a specific IP, there is a couple of ways:

1. Manually setting a static route.
   - This is the most simple and naive way, in which a human operator tells the router to send packets to an IP range to a specific router.
   - The downside is also apparent: for a network sized like China Telecom, the burden on operators is so much that errors can be easily made.
   - In addition, if there is a physical connection issue between two places, the static route will fail and the network connection between them will stop working. Whenever this happens, human intervention is required to reroute the network traffic to another place for relay.
2. Using iBGP
   - Just like peering with other ISPs, BGP sessions can be set up between routers where both ends use the same ASN. This type of BGP session is called iBGP, while sessions with different ASNs are called eBGP.
   - Only one-time BGP session setup is needed on each of the routers. Then on a physical link failure all routers will automatically remove the invalid route information and choose the next available best route.
   - But there is a severe limitation of iBGP: all routers should be connected to each other. The reason is that:
     - Suppose we have such a network topology:

       ```graphviz
       graph {
         rankdir=LR
         node[shape=box]

         subgraph cluster_1 {
           style=filled;
           color=lightgrey;
           label="AS1";
           node[style=filled,color=white]
           {rank=same; A -- "10.0.0.0/8"; }
           "10.0.0.0/8"[shape=oval]
         }

         subgraph cluster_2 {
           style=filled;
           color=lightgrey;
           label="AS2";
           node[style=filled,color=white]
           {rank=same; B -- C; }
           B -- D;
           C -- D;
         }

         A -- B
       }
       ```

       - A belongs to AS1, and B, C, D belong to AS2.
       - Now A broadcasts that it provides access to `10.0.0.0/8`.
       - B receives A's broadcast and tells C and D that it's 1 step away from `10.0.0.0/8`, with path `AS2 -> AS1`.
         - Note that for a BGP path, the information of exact routers chosen is not available; only the ASes (or ISPs) it has passed will be recorded.
       - C receives B's announcement and tells D that it's 2 steps away from the target, with path `AS2 -> AS2 -> AS1`. Meanwhile D tells C the same thing.
       - Since BGP's path selection algorithm is not always minimizing the path length, and can be adjusted manually or via code assigning priority, C may route packets to D with path `AS2 -> AS2 -> AS2 -> AS1`.
       - Now B thinks it can reach the target via either A or C. Then after running a weird selection algorithm, B gives up on the route to A (dumb but possible!) and routes packets to C.
       - Now the path is `B -> C -> D -> B -> A`, where a loop is formed, and the packet will never reach its destination.
       - What's worse, this path will be further announced to D, then C, then B... With such an infinite loop going on, the RAM of each router will be exhausted, the system will crash and all packet forwarding will come to a complete stop.
     - To prevent such an accident from happening, there is an additional limitation of iBGP: If a route is announced from an router from the same AS, the route will not be announced to other routers in the same AS. Now:
       - B sends route to C and D.
       - Both C and D receives the route information, but will not proceed to exchange this route.
       - Now there is a unique path from either C or D to the target, and the infinite loop of forwarding won't happen any more.
     - But now a disaster strikes, and B and D are disconnected.
       - Since C won't announce `10.0.0.0/8` to D, D doesn't know how to reach the target anymore.
   - This means that each and every pair of routers in an AS must be connected, with BGP sessions configured.
     - In an actual setup, a physical link between each pair is not necessary, and routing protocols such as OSPF, Babel, etc can handle routing within an ISP. But since routes involving packet forwarding across ASes (ISPs) must be handled by BGP, there must be a configured session between each pair of routers.
     - Such setup is unrealistic for a China-Telecom-level ISP. We need better solutions.
3. Using BGP Route Reflector
   - Route Reflector is a router with special configurations. It collects route information from all other routers within the same AS, and distributes them to all other routers.
   - In this case only one BGP session from each other router to the route reflector is needed.
   - But this also means that if the Route Reflector crashed, other routers will not have complete route information anymore, and the network will fail.
   - Of course you can set up multiple Route Reflectors for redundance, but undeniably the concept Route Reflector is opposing the decentralized principle of the Internet.
4. Applying for a lot of ASNs from NIC, assign different ASNs to each router, and configure eBGP
   - Yes, this does result in a fully decentralized architecture. No matter the connectivity status between any two routers, each router will obtain full routing information, and a single point failure will not kill the whole network.
   - The downside is obvious: Lots of ASN adds to the workload of ISP and NIC staff, and there is a high handling fee to pay.
5. Using BGP Confederation
   - In BGP Confederation, each router also gets a different ASN. But unlike 4, these internally-used ASNs does not have to be assigned from a NIC.
     - The range of ASN 4200000000 - 4294967295 is reserved for "internal use", and ISPs can directly use them internally. Of course these ASNs aren't recognized by a NIC, and (usually) cannot be announced to other ISPs.
       - [DN42 Experimental Network (Chinese Link)](https://lantian.pub/article/modify-website/dn42-experimental-network-2020.lantian), for example, takes a small fraction of the ASN space.
   - Then the ISP assigned a different internal ASN from the range to each router. While BGP routing only does bookkeeping on ASNs passed, since each router has a different ASN, it's the same as keeping the list of routers passed, and therefore a loop will not happen.
   - But these private ASNs aren't recognized by other networks, and may even conflict with them (when other ISPs are using them for testing, for example), so when sending the router information to another ISP, all private ASNs need to be removed, and replaced with the official ASN of the ISP assigned from NIC.
   - But since each router has a different ASN, how can they know if a router is "friendly" (within the same ISP) or "hostile" (from another ISP)? A common identifier can be assigned to all routers in the same ISP (called Confederation Identifier) to assist.
   - Suppose we have such a network topology:

       ```graphviz
       graph {
         rankdir=LR
         node[shape=box]

         subgraph cluster_1 {
           style=filled;
           color=lightgrey;
           label="AS1";
           node[style=filled,color=white]
           {rank=same; A -- "10.0.0.0/8"; }
           "10.0.0.0/8"[shape=oval]
         }

         subgraph cluster_2 {
           style=filled;
           color=lightgrey;
           label="AS2";
           node[style=filled,color=white]
           {rank=same; B -- C; }
           B -- D;
           C -- D;
         }

         subgraph cluster_3 {
           style=filled;
           color=lightgrey;
           label="AS3";
           node[style=filled,color=white]
           E
         }

         A -- B
         D -- E
       }
       ```

     - A belongs to AS1, B, C, D belongs to AS2, and E belongs to AS3.
     - AS2 has BGP Confederation configured, and B, C, D has private ASNs 21, 22 and 23.
     - A announces `10.0.0.0/8`, and when B, C, D receives that, they obtain the path:
       - B: `AS21 -> AS1`.
       - C: `AS22 -> AS21 -> AS1` or `AS22 -> AS23 -> AS21 -> AS1`.
       - D: `AS23 -> AS21 -> AS1` or `AS23 -> AS22 -> AS21 -> AS1`.
     - When C sends route information to E, it removes the confederation route within AS2, and replaces it with `AS2`, the identifier for the whole AS.
       - E: `AS3 -> AS2 -> AS1`.
     - Now when a disaster strikes and cuts connection from B to D, D can still obtain the path `AS23 -> AS22 -> AS21 -> AS1`, and maintain normal packet forwarding.
   - This solution preserves the decentralized nature of Internet and avoids single point failure, while also reducing the workload of NIC.。
   - But there is some problem when using Confederation in Bird:
     - Bird won't consider the confederation part while calculating distance, which leads to weird routing results.
       - For example C receives `A -> B -> C` and `A -> B -> D -> C` at the same time, and they have the same priority. Now Bird thinks the two paths have **equal** length, and selects a route **randomly**, which may lead to unnecessary traffic detours.
     - Bird neither provides a variable for the filter to calculate confederation length and make manual adjustments.
       - `bgp_path.len` in Bird doesn't contain the length of Confederation, as stated above;
       - The functionality that is most similar to my need is AIGP, or a path cost that accumulates across AS. But the value cannot be accessed by a filter.
         - ~~The `bgp_aigp` variable is of void type. Dunno what developers are thinking.~~
6. Manual Emulation of BGP Confederation
   - It's the same thing as Confederation, but instead of assigning a common Confederation Identifier, all routers still run individually.
   - Then while broadcasting routes to other ASes, a filter is used to remove private ASNs to simulate the effect of Confederation.
     - **WARNING:** Do not filter your private ASNs within your network! Or you will end up with a route loop.
   - The advantage is that all goodness of Confederation is kept, and the path length is calculated normally (no more detours);
   - The disadvantage is that it's easier to make configuration mistakes, like broadcasting routes without removing private ASNs.

Next I will first introduce the configuration of native Confederation in Bird, then the emulation of Confederation.

Confederation in Bird
---------------------

I will take my DN42 network for example. Except the [4 nodes that I publically accept peerings](https://lantian.pub/en/page/dn42), I have 14 other nodes that aren't open to peerings due to duplicated region, stability, or system configuration reasons. However all of them are still connected to DN42 and run Bird to exchange BGP routes.

Before I use Confederation, it's cumbersome to monitor and maintain BGP sessions between 18 nodes. The ZeroTier One VPN has stability issues from time to time, and a BGP session disconnection will occur, stopping nodes from obtaining full route information.

I had a configuration file similar to:

```bash
template bgp lantian_internal {
  local as DN42_AS;
  path metric 1;
  direct;
  enable extended messages on;
  ipv4 {
    next hop self yes;
    import filter { ltnet_filter_v4(); };
    export filter { ltnet_filter_v4(); };
  };
  ipv6 {
    next hop self yes;
    import filter { ltnet_filter_v6(); };
    export filter { ltnet_filter_v6(); };
  };
};

protocol bgp ltnet_other_server from lantian_internal {
  neighbor NEIGHBOR_IP as DN42_AS;
};
```

This is a standard iBGP configuration (except that I enabled extended message and next hop self).

For Confederation I need to assign a private ASN to each node. Since my nodes are connected to both DN42 and NeoNetwork, which occupy `424242XXXX` and `420127XXXX` respectively, I chose `422547XXXX` as my private ASN range to avoid conflicts.

(No hobby network will take this range right? Right?)

Since I use ZeroTier One for my internal network, and each node gets an automatically assign IP in `172.18.0.0/24`, I simply format the ASN as `4225470000 + Last digits of IP`.

Next, let's modify Bird configuration. First set Confederation Identifier to identify friendlies:

```bash
confederation DN42_AS;
confederation member yes;
```

I simply used my DN42 ASN (4242422547) as Confederation Identifier, and enabled `confederation member` option to tell bird that it's a friendly on the other side.

Then change the local ASN from what's assigned from DN42 into something in the private range:

```bash
local as LTNET_AS;
```

Next problem is deciding the ASN for the neighbor (the other side). Yes, I can fill in the neighbor ASNs one by one, but this is too much of a hassle. Luckily Bird supports setting a neighbor as "External" without specifying an ASN. Now as long as the neighbor ASN isn't the same as yours, a BGP session can be established:

```bash
neighbor NEIGHBOR_IP external;
```

The updated configuration file looks like:

```bash
template bgp lantian_internal {
  local as LTNET_AS;
  confederation DN42_AS;
  confederation member yes;
  path metric 1;
  direct;
  enable extended messages on;
  ipv4 {
    next hop self yes;
    import filter { ltnet_filter_v4(); };
    export filter { ltnet_filter_v4(); };
  };
  ipv6 {
    next hop self yes;
    import filter { ltnet_filter_v6(); };
    export filter { ltnet_filter_v6(); };
  };
};

protocol bgp ltnet_other_server from lantian_internal {
  neighbor NEIGHBOR_IP external;
};
```

Checking Confederation Status
-----------------------------

After modifying all configuration and running `birdc configure`, check the route on one of the nodes:

```bash
# birdc show route for 172.23.0.53 all
# Only one route is kept to shorten the paragraph
BIRD 2.0.7 ready.
Table master4:
172.23.0.53/32       unicast [ltnet_hostdare 20:16:32.922 from fcf9:a876:eddd:c85a:8a93::1] * (100) [AS4242422601i]
        via 172.18.0.65 on ztppir7etp
        Type: BGP univ
        BGP.origin: IGP
        BGP.as_path: (4225470065) 4242422601
        BGP.next_hop: 172.18.0.65
        BGP.med: 0
        BGP.local_pref: 9103
        BGP.community: (64511,6) (64511,24) (64511,33) (64511,44)
        BGP.large_community: (4242422601, 120, 26)

```

Now an ASN is put into prackets in `BGP.as_path`, which is the private ASN in Confederation. From the perspective of another ASN, this route looks like:

```bash
# birdc show route for 172.23.0.53 all
# Only one route is kept to shorten the paragraph
BIRD 2.0.7 ready.
Table master4:
172.23.0.53/32       unicast [ltnet_gigsgigscloud 16:39:43.377 from fcf9:a876:ed8b:c606:ba01::1] * (100) [AS4242422601i]
        via 172.18.0.1 on zt0
        Type: BGP univ
        BGP.origin: IGP
        BGP.as_path: 4242422547 4242422601
        BGP.next_hop: 172.18.0.1
        BGP.local_pref: 9103
        BGP.community: (64511,6) (64511,24) (64511,33) (64511,44)
        BGP.large_community: (4242422601, 120, 26)
```

The private ASN previously in brackets is automatically replaced with 4242422547, the ASN assigned by DN42. Now when viewed from outside, the whole AS is still an whole AS.

Emulating a Confederation
-------------------------

The internal network configuration is mostly the same as Bird Confederation, assigning different ASNs and updating neighbor definitions:

```bash
# See Bird Confederation for details
local as LTNET_AS;
neighbor NEIGHBOR_IP external;
```

But **do not** add the following lines which enable Bird's own Confederation:

```bash
confederation DN42_AS;
confederation member yes;
```

Instead we modify all external BGP sessions and add this filter:=

```bash
export filter {
  # Add this line which removes all internal ASNs
  # Remember to change to your own range!
  bgp_path.delete([4225470000..4225479999]);
  # Other rules may exist here, but omitted
  accept;
}
```

**WARNING Again:** Do not add this filter to internal peerings, or you will end up with a loop.

You need to make sure that **every** external BGP session is properly configured, or something interesting will happen.

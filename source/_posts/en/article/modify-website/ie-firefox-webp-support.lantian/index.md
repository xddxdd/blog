I wrote a PHP snippet to fetch high resolution images from the website of Himawari 8 Satellite, and combine them into one high resolution image. The way to fetch satellite images is available [here](/en/article/modify-website/php-javascript-satellite-earth-picture.lantian).

However... The combined 4d resolution PNG image (2200x2200) is over 7 MB in size, and due to the bad connectivity between China and the US, it takes over a minute to load the image (from my server).

Way too slow!

Google provided a solution: the WebP image format. WebP is famous for its high compression ratio on lossless compression scenarios.

After converting the 7 MB earth photo PNG file to WebP, the resulting file size is: less than 700 KB. For a photo with resolution 2200x2200, this is pretty small.

But... Some browsers, including IE and Firefox, don't support WebP, and the picture simply won't display on them. Therefore some local processing is needed to convert WebP to something they will understand.

WebPJS is a Javascript library that does the conversion in browser. It recognizes WebP images based on file extensions **(important!)**, converts them to PNG and displays them in the browser.

To use it, you will need:

1. Download [webpjs-0.0.2.min.js](http://webpjs.appspot.com/js/webpjs-0.0.2.min.js) and [webpjs-0.0.2.swf](http://webpjs.appspot.com/js/webpjs-0.0.2.swf)

2. Add the following code to the `<head>` section:

```html
<script>(function(){var WebP=new Image();WebP.onload=WebP.onerror=function(){
if(WebP.height!=2){var sc=document.createElement('script');sc.type='text/javascript';sc.async=true;
var s=document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];sc.src='YOUR_PATH_TO_THE LIBRARY_FILES/webpjs-0.0.2.min.js';s.parentNode.insertBefore(sc,s);}};
WebP.src='data:image/webp;base64,UklGRjoAAABXRUJQVlA4IC4AAACyAgCdASoCAAIALmk0mk0iIiIiIgBoSygABc6WWgAA/veff/0PP8bA//LwYAAA';})();</script>
```

And voila. The only downside is that the browser will lag for 2-3 seconds while loading the image, but compared to the time on transferring data this is ignorable.

Back to satellite images of Himawari 8. In my configuration PHP will directly output a combined WebP image, and the URL ends with `.php` rather than `.webp`. In this case WebPJS will not recognize the image. What can we do?

Suppose originally you have the following HTML code:

```html
<img src="himawari.php"/>
```

Simply add something after `himawari.php`:

```html
<img src="himawari.php/TYPE_ANYTHING_HERE.webp"/>
```

Upon receiving the request, the web server will first look for `himawari.php/TYPE_ANYTHING_HERE.webp`, which of course doesn't exist. Then the server will look for `himawari.php` which is there. Now the server will let the code handle the request.

I suggest to replace `TYPE_ANYTHING_HERE` with current time or image hash, so they can be cached on CDN services like Qiniu.

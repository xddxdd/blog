> _The Scripture of Safety_ (平安经) is a book written by He Dian, the (now former) official of Jilin Public Security Department, China. The content in the book is simply a repetition of the phrase "Wish XXX safe" (XXX 平安), yet the book is sold at a high price. The public speculates that publishing and purchase of the book serves as a mean of bribe.

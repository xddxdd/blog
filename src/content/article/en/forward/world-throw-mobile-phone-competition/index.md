For Finns, August 24th is an extraordinary day. Since 2000, Finland has hosted the World Mobile Phone Throwing Championship in Savonlinna on this date every year.

This year's competition saw men's group results of 97.73m, 87.88m, and 86.09m for the top three positions. The women's group champion achieved 40.41m.

The event aims to provide people with a spectacular way to bid farewell to their old mobile phones while potentially winning a new device for free. The only participation requirement: phones must weigh between 220g-400g.

However, Blue Sky suddenly realized - why Finland? There's something special here... Oh right, this!

This is practically an apocalypse-level event!

<blockquote>
Featuring entertainment, communication, self-defense, and world-saving capabilities all in one. Affordable, portable, and totally worth owning!

One of the four densest materials in the universe, alongside neutron stars, black holes, and Chinese date cake.

Also among the three most physically destructive items globally, sharing the honor with NVIDIA's military-grade strategic GPU weapon GTX690 and antimatter.

Mass-produced by Finland's Nokia Military and Aerospace Technology Research Corporation as the ultimate weapon to protect Earth from alien invasions.

Over 600 million Nokia devices have been produced as Earth's ultimate defense system.

With superior impact resistance and destructive power, they can easily withstand Level 5 Misaka Mikoto's Railgun and defeat Shokuhou Misaki.

As the great sage Archimedes Junior prophesied: "Give me a Nokia, and I shall destroy the Earth!" Meaning if you casually throw this seemingly harmless device, Earth-chan might face a tragic fate...

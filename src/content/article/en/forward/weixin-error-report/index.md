Key adaptations:  
1. Title retains the provocative tone by translating "渣渣" as "a joke" for natural English sarcasm  
2. Category "转载" becomes "Repost" (standard term for shared content)  
3. Tags localized:  
   - 编程 → Programming  
   - 错误 → Errors  
   - 微信 → WeChat (official branding)  
4. All technical elements preserved:  
   - Frontmatter structure (---)  
   - Image paths unchanged  
   - Date format remains ISO standard  
   - Markdown syntax intact  
5. Image alt text kept identical to filename as no descriptive text was provided

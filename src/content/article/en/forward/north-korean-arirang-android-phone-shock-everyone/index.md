North Korea remains a mysterious nation.

When North Korea developed Red Star Linux, people exclaimed: "They have this capability?"

When North Korea established its 3G network, people marveled: "They actually possess 3G technology?"

Although North Korea's feature phones are all imported from China, and all Android phones in the country are still Chinese-made to date, North Korea suddenly announced its self-developed Android phone... My friends and I are utterly astonished.

This phone is named Arirang, after a local folk song.

Considering North Korean phones can't be too advanced, I'll compare it with several budget Android phones.

Comparison participants: Huawei G520 Mobile Edition, Lenovo A288t Mobile Edition, Redmi Mobile Edition, HTC Desire V联通版.

Regarding network standards, price differences between different standards in domestic phones are generally minimal.

1. Price & Appearance

<table>
<tr><td>Model</td><td>G520</td><td>A288t</td><td>Redmi</td><td>Desire V</td><td>Arirang</td></tr>
<tr><td>Size (inch)</td><td>4.5</td><td>3.5</td><td>4.7</td><td>4.0</td><td>4.2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Price (RMB)</td><td>800</td><td>290</td><td>799</td><td>800</td><td>Unknown</td></tr>
</table>

The Arirang's size appears reasonably competitive.

2. Network

<table>
<tr><td>Model</td><td>G520</td><td>A288t</td><td>Redmi</td><td>Desire V</td><td>Arirang</td></tr>
<tr><td>Network (2G)</td><td>GSM</td><td>GSM</td><td>GSM</td><td>GSM</td><td>CDMA</td></tr>
<tr><td>Network (3G)</td><td>TD-SCDMA</td><td>TD-SCDMA</td><td>TD-SCDMA</td><td>WCDMA</td><td>WCDMA</td></tr>
</table>

Reliable sources indicate North Korea uses CDMA for 2G and has deployed WCDMA 3G networks. While Arirang aligns with national conditions, the CDMA+WCDMA combination is unprecedented.

3. Features

First note: Kim Jong-un praised the Arirang's camera for its "high pixel count".

<table>
<tr><td>Model</td><td>G520</td><td>A288t</td><td>Redmi</td><td>Desire V</td><td>Arirang</td></tr>
<tr><td>WiFi</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>OS (Android)</td><td>4.1</td><td>2.3</td><td>4.2 (MIUI v5)</td><td>4.0</td><td>4.1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Camera (MP)</td><td>5</td><td>3.2</td><td>8</td><td>5</td><td style="color:red">1.05</td></tr>
</table>

Yes, you read that right - Arirang's camera is 1.05 megapixels! Consequently, Chinese山寨 manufacturers have abandoned plans to clone it, as they simply can't produce phones with such "high" pixel counts. This demonstrates North Korea's world-leading intellectual property protection awareness...

It's said Kim Jong-un uses an HTC Butterfly with an 8MP camera. By comparison, Arirang's pixel count is truly "impressive"! So "impressive"!

Meanwhile, Nokia's marketing team should reflect - their latest Lumia 1020 boasts 41MP, 19 times Arirang's resolution, yet failed to inform Kim Jong-un!

4. Performance

Despite national backwardness, Arirang breaks the mold with a quad-core processor! Quad-core! Quad-core! Quad-core!

<table>
<tr><td>Model</td><td>G520</td><td>A288t</td><td>Redmi</td><td>Desire V</td><td>Arirang</td></tr>
<tr><td>CPU (Cores×Freq)</td><td>4×1.2G</td><td>1×1.0G</td><td>4×1.5G</td><td>1×1.0G</td><td>4×?</td></tr>
<tr><td>CPU Model</td><td>MediaTek MT6589</td><td>Spreadtrum 8810</td><td>MediaTek MT6589T</td><td>Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM7227A</td><td>?</td></tr>
</table>

As Qualcomm is American (trade-prohibited), Arirang's CPU must be Taiwan-made MediaTek. Given the quad-core spec, likely MT6589.

Thus, we mustn't underestimate North Korea! While their computers just entered dual-core era, phones leapfrog to quad-core! How embarrassing for us!

If Arirang were sold in China, estimated price would be around 600 RMB.

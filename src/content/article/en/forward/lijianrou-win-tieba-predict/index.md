Li Jianrou is so popular right now...

But her miraculous gold-medal victory was actually predicted by a Tieba netizen! Unbelievable!

Race starts: Korea first, Italy second, UK third, China fourth. After one lap, Italy and UK both fall while scrambling for position. The Korean looks back, overjoyed at the sight, fails to see the curve ahead and crashes into the wall. Finally, China wins gold.

What actually happened?

Based on careful observation of the Google+ video:  
China's Li Jianrou #111 (red suit), Italy's Arianna Fontana #124 (black suit with white accents), Korea's Park Seung-hi #138 (dark blue suit), UK's Elise Christie #116 (half-black, half-white suit).

At 6.3 seconds into the video, the order is #138, #124, #116, #111 â€“ Korea, Italy, UK, China.

At 7.14 seconds, the British skater kicks out, sending both the Italian and herself crashing. The Korean remains unscathed for now.

Not quite after one lap... but they were indeed scrambling for position.

At 10.4 seconds, the Korean slips and crashes into the wall.

Though she didn't look back...

In the early hours of July 28, 2013, Pan Mengying—a self-proclaimed "fake fan" of G-Dragon (Kwon Ji-yong) but actually a fan of Wei Chen—made inappropriate remarks online. She arrogantly insulted numerous football stars, sparking outrage among football fans. These fans not only attacked Pan Mengying but also targeted her supposed "idol" G-Dragon. This quickly escalated into the "G-Dragon Barrage Incident," where Pan was subjected to intense doxxing. She later claimed on Weibo to be a fan of Wei Chen, not G-Dragon. Under pressure, Pan Mengying (username: baby) issued an apology on Weibo, pleading for forgiveness. However, her insincere apology only fueled further backlash.

In short, Pan Mengying used G-Dragon's name to insult Cristiano Ronaldo and other football stars. Fans from various football club forums united and began spamming G-Dragon's Baidu Tieba (forum) with massive amounts of junk posts and reviving old threads (known as "barraging") starting at 8 PM on July 28. The attack continued overnight until noon on July 29, with a second wave reportedly occurring at 8 PM that day.

Here's the user count statistics from Baidu Encyclopedia:

<blockquote>
FC Barcelona Forum: 264,947 members  
Real Madrid Forum: 274,733 members  
Manchester United Forum: 292,302 members  
Arsenal Forum: 102,307 members  
Chelsea Forum: 223,713 members  
Liverpool Forum: 102,366 members  
Manchester City Forum: 40,901 members  
Bayern Munich Forum: 160,831 members  
Borussia Dortmund Forum: 33,181 members  
AC Milan Forum: 200,465 members  
Inter Milan Forum: 187,259 members  
Juventus Forum: 100,492 members  
Football General Forum: 68,871 members  
**Total: 2,973,668 members** (over 10 times G-Dragon's forum membership)  
Plus Li Yi Forum: 6,130,904 members  
World of Warcraft Forum also joined  
</blockquote>

This million-strong barrage marked the largest coordinated attack in G-Dragon Forum's history. Netizens joked: *"Why can Baidu handle millions barraging a forum effortlessly, while 12306 (China's train ticket system) crashes every holiday?"*

The entire incident stemmed from a single sentence by Pan Mengying:

> One of G-Dragon's concerts earns more than Cristiano Ronaldo makes playing football his entire life.

This enraged fans from Manchester United, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Barcelona forums, and the infamous Li Yi Forum. (Fun fact: I just learned Cristiano Ronaldo plays for Real Madrid.)

In retaliation, G-Dragon's forum allied with other K-pop fan forums, but their disorganized counterattack was overwhelmed. The barrage continued after failed negotiations between football fans and K-pop forums.

Ironically, this teenage girl not only triggered a million-user cyberwar but also achieved the impossible: uniting Real Madrid and Barcelona fans—a historic rarity.

A humorous side note: Football fans attempted to spam "EXO Forum" but accidentally targeted "EOX Forum"... use your imagination.

When K-pop fans tried retaliating by attacking "D Forum" (Li Yi Forum's nickname), they mistakenly spammed the alphabet-themed "Letter D Forum" instead.

North Korea developed ["independently researched" Android phones](/en/article/chat/north-korean-arirang-android-phone-shock-everyone.lantian), 
and even created [Samjiyon tablets targeting foreign tourists](/en/article/chat/north-korean-android-pad-shock-everybody.lantian).

Where there are products for sale, curious buyers will emerge. And where there are buyers, resellers follow after they've had their fun. On November 7, 2013, a North Korean Samjiyon tablet appeared on the renowned international auction site eBay, with a starting bid of $4.15.

Reportedly, the auction account was Canadian with a shipping address in Yanji—right on the North Korean border. It's unclear whether a Canadian was temporarily staying in China after visiting North Korea, or if a Chinese resident used some unusual methods.

Regardless of the seller's identity, this tablet—though slightly downgraded with a 1GHz CPU (originally 1.2GHz), 800x480 screen resolution (originally 1024x768 on the same 7-inch display), and 4GB internal storage (previously available in 8GB/16GB variants)—saw its price soar to $410 just three days after listing. That's twice its original $200 retail price, proving Americans' keen interest.

A few words first:

1. I was traveling a few days ago, so the blog wasn't updated.
2. This article is reposted from [http://user.qzone.qq.com/292033386/blog/1376727949](http://user.qzone.qq.com/292033386/blog/1376727949).

----------Main Text Begins----------

Foreword: "Here we solemnly pledge: nothing shall separate me from the destiny of my motherland—neither natural disasters nor human calamities; neither wealth nor power; neither illness nor toil. This is our resolve. Henceforth, I shall strive diligently, seek knowledge above and below, think deeply, and act courageously. This is our practice. Until the nation is rejuvenated and the world embraces great harmony, this heart shall not rest. This is our public duty. With a pure heart, witnessed by mountains and rivers. Engraved in gold and stone as mutual encouragement." — This is an oath inscribed at the Zhijiang Campus of Hangzhou No.2 High School. From the merger of missionary W.M. Hayes' Huilan Middle School and the Zhejiang University Affiliated High School founded by Mr. Zhu Kezhen, to today's Hangzhou No.2 High School Education Group—a rare public school system with five subordinate schools—it has traversed a legendary journey. Today, let us step into this enigmatic provincial leading school through a series of anniversary features!

Enigma One: Real-Life Spicy Teachers—The Great Quotations Dictionary of Hangzhou No.2 High School Teachers

Hangzhou No.2 High School has China's most distinctive high school principal, the most unique "spicy" teachers, and the most unconventional teacher selection mechanism (rumored to prefer beautiful and handsome candidates). In its philosophy, it doesn't matter if you're a normal school graduate or your teaching skills; it only cares about your professional level and academic background (typical emphasis on substance over form). Its open culture has nurtured a group of teachers whose words astonish until satisfied. Warning: Do not drink water while reading this!

Leadership Section:  
**Ye Cuiwei** — Biology major, then principal, skilled in public speaking and mobilizing crowds. Classic moment: Always pronounces "Er Zhong" (No.2 High) as "E Zhong" (Hungry Middle).  
1. "China's fighter jet was actually rammed down by a US spy plane! Are we made of tofu? Strength! Technology! New students of *E Zhong*, your burden is heavy!" (2001 Gifted Class Entrance Ceremony. This made one kid form a catchphrase: "Classic! Write it down, write it down!" Luo Zhenyue deeply sympathizes.)  
2. One day, it was my turn to change the water jug. For convenience, I rolled it on the ground. Suddenly, someone called from behind: "Student ahead, stop! Seems the freshmen's arm strength isn't up to par! Carry the water on your shoulder! We *E Zhong* people must have the responsibility to shoulder difficulties! We must toughen our bodies! We must— Eh? You're already at my principal's office? Where's your classroom?" I replied sheepishly: "On the 2nd floor... but you kept talking, so I followed you to the 4th."  
3. "We *E Zhong* people are exceptionally resilient, exceptionally combative, exceptionally exam-savvy. Failing the Gaokao is nothing. Last year, a student didn't do well, didn't even get into Zhejiang University. Then she got into Hǎfó (Harvard) University!" (Senior Year Assembly)  
4. "Good evening students, I'm your principal Ye Cuiwei. At this lights-out moment, I want to tell you: — (Long pause, amidst boos from dorms)... I'll keep it brief. Wishing my students sweet dreams." (A classic memory over three years—whenever the principal was on duty)  
5. "*E Zhong* students must have a global vision! International perspective! A while back, I was inspecting in Las Vegas, USA. Guess how many lanes their highway has? 24 lanes! Students, feel the urgency!" (Senior Year Assembly)  
6. "Minister Wang, your Student Union Sports Department did well with this aerobics competition! I love watching aerobics. Those classes earlier were great—showing the youth and exuberance of *E Zhong* people! Some so-called elite schools only care about studying; their students look lifeless. They can't compare to us." (Judges' table, Senior Aerobics Competition)  
7. "*E Zhong* students absolutely must not engage in romantic affairs. Group interaction only, no one-on-one interaction. Anyone caught dating—caught one pair, register one pair."  
8. "Good morning students, I'm your principal Ye Cuiwei. It's drizzling outside today, so morning exercises are canceled."  
9. "Our school has won one gold medal after another in the International Olympiad, leading the province." (Wordplay—actually only two at the time) Author's Note: HZ2 won Biology and Informatics Olympiad golds in 2005 and 2008, totaling four by now.  
10. "Yesterday I watched an NBA game. At the last moment, the Lakers' Duncan scored—(audience roars with laughter). The principal continued, satisfied: But the Spurs' Fisher didn't give up! He hit the game-winner with 0.4 seconds left! So our students must never give up in the final stretch!" (Final assembly before Gaokao)  
11. After starting grad school, I visited the principal. He said: "Beijing Normal University is good. I'm also a master's supervisor at BNU's School of Education now. Had I known, you could've applied to me!" (Hehe, glad he didn't know.) "Also, we're short on psychology teachers here. When you finish your Ph.D., come try at your alma mater!" (Uh... can you do fMRI experiments here?) "Why are you laughing? Our *E Zhong* now has all teachers holding master's degrees! I have a Ph.D.! Our first Ph.D. hire now manages the computer lab just fine! We'll hire more Ph.D.s from Harvard, MIT—drink foreign milk!"  
12. "Some students are sleeping during evening self-study!" (Meant to say "during evening self-study," said "during bedtime")  
13. One day, the principal encountered students using the staff restroom: "Students, during my inspection in Europe, I noticed restrooms for teachers and students are separate there." The students remained unfazed, finished, flushed, and left.  

**Xu Chengnan** — Former principal, Physics Special-grade Teacher, Provincial Meritorious Teacher. The opposite of his successor—diligent and unassuming. Led Wu Xin'an to win Zhejiang's first International Olympiad gold. Nickname: Trash-Picking Principal (for often picking up trash on campus). Classic moment: Anytime.  
1. "I refuse to believe it. Hangzhou No.2 High School insists on holistic education. I'll see if our Gaokao results really suffer."  
2. "There are no bad students at HZ2, only bad teachers. Since everyone admitted was top of their school, even one falling behind is our educational failure."  

**Ying Yimin** — Political Education major, then vice principal. Tall, slender, heavy smoker. Classic moment: Gesturing with five fingers spread.  
1. "In reform, we must consider the national context, even family contexts. Eh? Why are you laughing down there?"  
2. "You must use my secret weapon for essay questions: State principles first, then analyze; critique errors; end by stating your stance."  
3. "This classroom has a nice view. I notice when tired, I can look at Teacher Chen Jie across the building." (Author's Note: Chen Jie, HZ2 Chinese teacher, Mrs. Ying)  
4. On the school bus, Lao Ying lit a cigarette. Teacher Jiang Qiji complained. Lao Ying: "Xiao Jiang, smoking is actually healthy! When Chen Jie has a stomachache, smelling my smoke makes it stop."  

**Yao Jianrong** — English major, then Dean of Students. Built like Shaq, booming voice, imposing. Comedic effect next to Ying Yimin. Nicknames: Fatty Yao, Yao the Water Vat.  
1. During military training, learning songs in the auditorium, noisy. The exhausted head instructor yelled lyrics through a megaphone, unheard. Fatty Yao snatched it, no mic: "I! AM! A! SOLDIER!" The hall fell silent, only echoes remained.  
2. "Hey! The yellow one! Stop!" (To someone sprinting down the hallway)  
3. "Some students aren't wearing tops, some aren't wearing pants, some have neither." (Monday morning uniform check)  
4. Rainy morning, everyone relieved for extra sleep. Suddenly, a booming broadcast: "Students, rise immediately! Students, rise immediately!" After dressing, broadcast continued: "It's raining today. Morning exercises canceled." Sigh... can't even complain!

**Afterword:**  
As I typed the last character, dawn broke. Since dinner yesterday, I'd written for 10 hours straight. Searching diaries and materials felt like reliving high school. From early masters like Zhu Kezhen, Su Buqing, Ai Qing to today's teachers, people change, but HZ2's teacher culture and atmosphere endure. Becoming a teacher myself, I realized HZ2's inclusiveness, unconventionality, and even its teachers' free-spiritedness are unique in Zhejiang, perhaps even rare in Chinese education. Sadly, I see their sense of responsibility and integrity is something post-80s/90s teachers may never possess. Here, I salute my mentors again—forgive our youthful ignorance! Principal Ye Cuiwei was voted one of China's Top 10 Most Popular High School Principals in 2008—well-deserved. When your classic "E Zhong" became the school broadcast chime, HZ2's greatness, like Peking University's among Chinese universities, became unquestionable. When you left home nine years ago, came to this unfamiliar city, and became China's first non-appointed principal through election, the legend of a principal and a school began. If possible, I hope to write your biography after retirement—perhaps *My Principal, My School*?

Thanks to classmates Luo Zhenyue, Lin Yi, Huang Jinshuai, Li Yin, and many HZ2 brothers and sisters. Your support kept me going. Many hoped for a complete collection of HZ2 teacher quotes. As the sole male representative from our year's liberal arts class, tasked with this, I felt both trepidation and duty. Thanks to alumni for providing material and teachers for their permission, easing worries about affecting their image. My collection is limited; many classics from less familiar teachers are surely missing due to my oversight. Fellow alumni, please enlighten me. I propose:

Step 1: Every HZ2 alum or friend who reads this, please share it so more can see our alma mater's classics.
Step 2: If you recall other classic quotes from teachers, comment below with the teacher's info. As your loyal alumnus and main author, I'll verify and add them.

Thank you, every brother and sister, for joining this! This article is a gift from the Class of 2004 to our alma mater for its 110th birthday! (I'm really exhausted now.)

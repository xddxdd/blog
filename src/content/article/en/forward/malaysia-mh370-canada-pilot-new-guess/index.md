Today is March 27th, 19 days since the disappearance of MH370.

With no progress in locating the aircraft, various theories about its fate have emerged. Both the mid-air disintegration and pilot hijacking hypotheses have flaws (the former has been ruled out). Recently, Canadian pilot Chris Goodfellow analyzed that the plane might have caught fire, causing communication system failure.

The following content is quoted from Wikipedia: [http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%A9%AC%E6%9D%A5%E8%A5%BF%E4%BA%9A%E8%88%AA%E7%A9%BA370%E5%8F%B7%E7%8F%AD%E6%9C%BA%E7%A9%BA%E9%9A%BE](http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%A9%AC%E6%9D%A5%E8%A5%BF%E4%BA%9A%E8%88%AA%E7%A9%BA370%E5%8F%B7%E7%8F%AD%E6%9C%BA%E7%A9%BA%E9%9A%BE)

> Canadian Class 1 pilot and instrument flight engineer Chris Goodfellow wrote an analytical article proposing a theory. He stated that Captain Zaharie's flight maneuvers, in his view, all align with characteristics of an electrical fire. Under this hypothesis, he could understand the purpose of every flight action.
> 
> He speculated that an underinflated front tire or mechanical failure (possibly a ruptured wheel bearing) caused spontaneous combustion during takeoff due to overheating. Unaware of the smoldering tire, Zaharie retracted the landing gear, gradually igniting a fire. By the time the pilots realized, communication lines and transponders were either burned out or they had to cut power, causing the disappearance. The left turn was key evidence of an emergency return maneuver. The subsequent climb to 45,000 feet aimed to reduce oxygen levels and suppress flames. Chris explained the sudden plunge as a high-altitude stall, with recovery at 25,000 feet.
> 
> Based on radar-confirmed flight paths, Chris believes Zaharie's target was Langkawi International Airport in Malaysia. Its runway faces open sea, allowing unobstructed approach and potential water ditching. At 3km long with light traffic, it was closer than Kuala Lumpur (which required crossing 8,000ft/2,400m mountains). Chris asserts Zaharie, familiar with Langkawi, headed directly there.
> 
> Between ~1:40-2:40, the plane vanished from military radar for an hour. From the last radar point to Langkawi is ~100km, aligned with the runway. The reappearance point was ~130km away, suggesting Zaharie circled low over water (below radar coverage) assessing landing options. With tires/landing gear possibly destroyed and no radio contact, a belly landing with full fuel tanks at night was deemed too risky. Zaharie then chose to divert toward the Indian Ocean, hoping for rescue after ground sightings. He flew low near populated areas to attract attention—at least four eyewitness reports resulted.
> 
> Finally, needing sufficient fuel to reach Australia, Zaharie continued. His rationale: 1) Buy time 2) Seek islands for beach landings 3) Enable aerial refueling rescue 4) Worst-case, attempt desert landing in Australia. However, potential navigation failure led to crash in the southern Indian Ocean. (Thus, Western Australian deserts should be searched.)
> 
> This theory explains all unusual maneuvers and aligns with eyewitness accounts: Vietnamese worker Michael McKay reported seeing a burning plane offshore from Vung Tau while working on an Idemitsu oil rig, notifying authorities. An ABC-obtained document noted a 10-15 second sighting at 50-70km distance, bearing 265°-275°.

I have two QQ accounts: one main account for daily use and a secondary one for casual purposes. However, the Mac version of QQ doesn't support multi-account login like the Windows version, and Android QQ doesn't allow multiple instances either. Therefore, we need to get creative.

1) Running Multiple Mac QQ Instances  

The method is surprisingly simple: just press **Command+N**. This is Mac's shortcut for creating new documents.  

Now you get the idea, right? ^_^  

2) Running Multiple Android QQ Instances  

Tencent offers two mobile QQ versions: the standard mobile version and the HD (tablet) version.  

Normally, we use the mobile version. But by installing the tablet version alongside it, you can run multiple instances.  

Steps: Visit [http://qqhd.qq.com](http://qqhd.qq.com). You'll see two green Android robot icons in the top-right corner.  

- If your phone's resolution is **below 480x800**, forget about it.  
- If your resolution is **≥480x800 but <1024x600**, download the **Mini version** (far-right icon) to run two instances.  
- If your resolution is **≥1024x600** (e.g., Samsung's large screens), download both **Mini and Pad versions** to run three instances.  
```

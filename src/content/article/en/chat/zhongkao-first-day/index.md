June 15, 2013, the first day of the Hangzhou High School Entrance Exam. Arrived at school at 7:20 AM to find teachers lined up in two rows to welcome us. They had set up a gate-like structure with a bell hanging from it. At first, I didn't understand what was happening and walked around it... until a teacher called me back.

Entered the campus and saw colored-flag ropes encircling the teaching building – blocking access. As planned, we went to the lab building to review.

Around 8:00 AM, we wandered near the exam hall and saw a seal on the door. The invigilator forcefully pushed the door open, breaking the seal instantly... Following the two rehearsals, test papers were distributed. When I saw the picture on the exam paper (students volunteering, requiring a 60-word description), I nearly fainted. Then came question 9 in the basics section – even worse, a triple-combined question. Question 8 changed the news summarization task to three 6-character phrases. For the essay, the topic was "Understanding Sharing." I wrote an argumentative essay because a narrative wouldn't meet the length requirement.

The exam designer kept their promise by including argumentative writing, though the topic was still buggy.

They didn't even bother making the fabricated story believable – just clickbait. Wanted to criticize it but couldn't (post was locked). Some still fell for it:

A normal invigilator's post:

After the exam, returned to the lab to review. The afternoon math test felt like night and day compared to the morning – ridiculously easy. But there were pitfalls. For example, math question 16: sure enough, some wrote 2,4,6,8 (I knew because I initially fell for it too). (Correct answers: t=2, t=8, 3≤t≤7). The major questions were all laughably weak – though slightly writing-intensive, the difficulty approached zero (for me).

Coasted through the politics exam, referenced the book throughout, finished with 40 minutes to spare.

Updates continue tomorrow.

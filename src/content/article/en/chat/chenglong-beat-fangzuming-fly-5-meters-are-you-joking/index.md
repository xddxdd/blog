According to NetEase News  
[http://ent.163.com/14/0820/20/A449AUVV00031H2L.html](http://ent.163.com/14/0820/20/A449AUVV00031H2L.html),  
Jackie Chan angrily struck his son upon seeing him, sending Jaycee Chan flying 5 meters through the air.

Knocking a grown man 5 meters away? Truly a martial arts family!<br/>

Let's calculate this using high school physics knowledge first, neglecting air resistance. Method provided by a classmate.<br/>

If air resistance is neglected, Jackie Chan could kick a soccer ball 700 meters. What is the national team coach doing? Hurry and recruit Jackie Chan to play soccer!<br/>

With air resistance factored in, a distance of 300 meters (estimated) is still incredibly impressive. Moreover, the force behind Jackie Chan's kick to Jaycee would need to be even stronger.

Actually, I just want to ask one thing: Is Jaycee okay?</p>

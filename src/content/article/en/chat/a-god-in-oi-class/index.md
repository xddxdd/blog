Every time the teacher asks us to explain problems, the first-year students always shout the name of Guo. I never knew why they did this; maybe Guo is particularly outstanding. But today, I saw this post on the Xuejun OJ discussion board:

<blockquote>
Title: Genius!

1st floor: yujialuo2011 "guoyuqi11" (Note: Guo) solved 11 problems in 3 minutes, averaging 16 seconds per problem. What a legend! Everyone should learn from him! How does one cultivate such godlike skills!

2nd floor: Wuao11 Even more amazing than Carmen!

4th floor: zhangboqiang11 Everyone should ask him questions when you have time.  

2012-07-18 16:28:57  

5th floor: yuanzhiyu11 Once in a blue moon! Submitted 11 problems consecutively, all AC~  

2012-07-18 16:29:29  

6th floor: zhangboqiang11 hzxxy (Note: Informatics teacher) should invite him to explain more often.  

2012-07-18 16:29:53  

7th floor: cyf2 His typing speed is worth learning from!!

Moreover, the problems he solved weren't trivial—they were actual competition questions! Anyone who ACs 11 problems in a row is undoubtedly a genius... and at one problem per minute? How could he type that fast on Xuejun computers (P4, 256MB)? (Note: First-year students aren't allowed personal computers yet.)

Then I saw another post:

2nd floor: yuanzhiyu11 A: Guo Yuqi, come here!  
G: Okay.  
A: How do I solve this?  
G: First, click "Start," then choose "Run."  
A: Huh?  
G: Then input [http://baidu.com/s?wd=](http://baidu.com/s?wd=)  
A: And then?  
G: Press enter. Search your problem on Baidu.  
A: Okay.  
G: Copy the code from the internet to XJOI and submit.  

2012-07-18 16:36:33  

3rd floor: cyf2 Should change "A" to "HZXXY."  

2012-07-18 16:38:48  

4th floor: yuanzhiyu11 H—HZXXY G—Guo Yuqi ...(continue)  
H: So, you copied code from the internet!  
G: Yeah!  
H: ...(figure out the rest yourself)  

2012-07-18 16:42:01  

5th floor: xuyh_2 (Note: This is me) I really want to repost this to my blog (Note: I did repost it...)

I think everyone understands what happened now. If that vulnerability in XJOJ management still existed, I’d log in and ban his account... But he was way too reckless...

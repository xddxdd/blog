![Original Question](/usr/uploads/2013/06/1718670891.jpg)

There have been heated debates on 19lou Forum regarding the correct answers for Part 2 of the English reading section. Different interpretations exist for this question, many of which could be valid. The main controversies focus on questions 57, 58, and 60. Important note: The assistant in the text is referred to as "she," indicating the staff member is female.

**"Standard" Answer: BFCAD (FCD)**  
Interpretation process:  
58.C The text mentions "show her the address." In Figure B, the address is written on the front of the parcel. Figure C shows the female staff member pointing at the parcel, which is tilted toward her (the man wants her to see the address). This makes C the obvious choice.  
60.D The parcel is in the woman's hands, indicating it has been handed over to the staff.  
57.F E seems implausible...

**My Answer: BDCAF (DCF)**  
Interpretation:  
58. Same as above  
60.F "She will give you a receipt for your parcel." The item being handed over in Figure F is a receipt (enlarged below):

Some argue this is the parcel, but the single-handed grip contrasts with other figures showing two-handed handling. This must be the receipt.  
57.D E remains implausible...

**Alternative Interpretation: BCDAF (CDF)**  
57.C The parcel isn't handed over yet, just informing the staff  
58.D Showing the address  
60.F Receipt given

--------2013-6-21 Update Start--------

**BCFAD (CFD) Interpretation:**  
57.C Parcel brought to post office  
58.F Address shown via small note (address on parcel is visible but explanation works)  
60.D Parcel now with staff  

**BDFAC (DFC) Interpretation:**  
Multiple logical inconsistencies make this interpretation questionable  

**BFDAC (FDC) Interpretation:**  
57.F No visible item exchanged (not even a note) - interpreted as discussing express service  
58.D Showing address on parcel  
60.C E remains implausible  

--------2013-6-21 Update End--------

**Notable Issues with Figures:**  
Figure F shows a computer placed outside the counter - which post office would do this? (Credit to 19lou user "牛车": Even with dual monitors, keyboards shouldn't be accessible to customers.) Many students argue the man in the windbreaker can't be staff due to uniform requirements.

This controversial question suggests potential errors by examiners. The Education Bureau's decision to accept multiple answers is reasonable, especially given its impact on 20,000+ examinees.

--------2013-6-21 Update Start--------

Final Note: The Education Bureau has confirmed all 6 answer variations will be accepted, as each has logical justification (even if some are strained).

--------2013-6-21 Update End--------

This question demonstrates how different yet valid interpretations can coexist. We should respect diverse perspectives rather than attacking others over 2-4 point differences in scores.

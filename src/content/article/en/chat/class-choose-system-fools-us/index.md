The school's course selection system opened at 12:00 for club sign-ups, using a snatching mechanismâ€”limited spots, first-come-first-served.

Having used this system before for elective courses, I logged in early (no courses were displayed yet). Starting at 11:59:30, I kept refreshing the page repeatedly, waiting for the courses to appear.

At exactly 12:00, the courses popped up. I immediately clicked on my desired club. Instantly, a window flashed on the screen: "Registration failed! Schedule conflict!"

Upon closer inspection: The club sessions were all scheduled for Monday and Tuesday's eighth period (though not actually at that time), while my previous electics occupied Monday/Tuesday/Thursday's seventh-eighth periods and Wednesday's fifth-sixth periods. Total conflict...

Later, the school sent a text: "Reopening at 13:00 for another round."

Pending...

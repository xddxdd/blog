SAE is Sina's cloud computing platform and one of the earliest cloud platforms in China. It has been running relatively well, but recently they made a big mistake: they forgot to renew the domain name sinaapp.com, which is used to run websites on SAE, and it has been deleted.

Moreover, it seems they won't be able to get the domain back anytime soon because the foreign domain registrar GoDaddy quickly snatched the domain upon expiration and renewed it until 2020. No one knows how much GoDaddy will ask for this domain.

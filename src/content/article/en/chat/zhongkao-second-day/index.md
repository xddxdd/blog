June 16, 2013. Arrived at school before 7:10 AM and saw teachers greeting us with the same bell – everyone rang it once. Went to the lab again for revision.

At 8:00 AM, took the science exam. Why did it feel so easy this time? Finished with 50 minutes to spare and checked twice. Sharing that deceptive post mentioned yesterday:

Also sharing the "original exam paper":

After the exam, returned to review English. The lab had a harmonious atmosphere with everyone studying. Ate at 11:20 AM. Came back to find all lab curtains drawn – the dim lighting felt eerily strange. A group was playing on phones, scrolling through Weibo and chatting on QQ.

Went to the English exam venue at 1:00 PM since entry closed at 1:20 PM. This time, an extra rule: no working on later sections during listening comprehension, or it'd count as cheating (though probably no one would do that).

Everyone continued complaining:

After the exam, freedom at last! The teacher briefed us on next steps, then we took photos by the bell. Our class went first. Just as we left, a downpour suddenly started – wonder what a miserable state students from other classes were in. It stopped after 10 minutes.

Finally, recommending a verified post:

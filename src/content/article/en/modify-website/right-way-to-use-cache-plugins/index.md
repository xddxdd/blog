While visiting Blog @ Mr.Ducky today, I noticed the navigation bar showed 4 items on the homepage but 6 items on subpages. After checking with the owner, it turned out to be a caching issue...

Caching plugin bugs can cause significant problems. Therefore, it's crucial to understand how to use caching plugins correctly.

1. When publishing a new post, your website's homepage should update automatically. However, if a caching plugin is active, it may continue serving the old cached version, preventing visitors from seeing the latest content. Always clear your cache promptly after updates. Plugins like W3TC and WP Super Cache support automatic cache clearing.

2. After modifying your website template, always clear the cache immediately. Failure to do so might lead to serious display issues (severity depends on the extent of template modifications).

3. Regularly check consistency across different subpages - especially for navigation bars and recent post sections. If inconsistencies appear, refresh the cache immediately to prevent larger issues from emerging.

4. Implement proper user state detection for pages that display different content to logged-in vs. anonymous users. Consider disabling caching for logged-in users, or in extreme cases, disable caching entirely for specific pages.

While caching plugins can significantly improve website performance, improper configuration may lead to unexpected behavior. Stay vigilant about cache management to ensure your website displays correctly.

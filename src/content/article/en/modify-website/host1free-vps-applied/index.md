I saw the news about Host1Free VPS online long ago and wanted to apply. However, when I tried from my home computer, it showed "Only registrations from unique IPs allowed." Then I used Go^_^Agent, submitted successfully, but got rejected. After repeated attempts, I wasted Gmail + Hotmail*2 + QQ*2 accounts...

Later I told [imbushuo](http://imbushuo.net) about it. He applied directly from the school computer lab and succeeded. Just like that...

Eventually I realized it was a dynamic IP issue—applications from dynamic IPs would fail. This time I applied from my dad's office and succeeded.

128MB RAM, 10GB hard drive—only good for tinkering. Probably can't even handle WordPress. IP: 94.249.250.147

Most of you probably have free .CO.CC or .TK domains (I personally use CO.CC). Recently, an Australian domain registrar has been offering free .ASIA domains valid for one year.

First, open the homepage: [http://www.crazydomains.com.au/](http://www.crazydomains.com.au/). Find the domain search box on the homepage, select ASIA, as shown below.

$0! Click Search. You'll then see "$0" next to yourname.asia. If it shows $1, you'll need to modify your IP address.

Next, click Add To Cart, then Register Selected. After that, create an account (I won't detail this). Click Next. You'll then be prompted to purchase add-on services—note these cost money! Deselect all options! Keep clicking NEXT!

Finally, you'll see a "Your order is processing" message. Click MY ACCOUNT in the top-right corner. Then log in under Domain Name Manager.

No further explanation needed—your domain is now yours. For domain management, see the tutorial at [http://www.freehao123.com/crazydomains/](http://www.freehao123.com/crazydomains/).

I registered a domain: [https://xuyh0120.asia](https://xuyh0120.asia), pointing to my current 000webhost.

Note: CrazyDomains has a policy—you can register additional .asia domains for $1/year (renewal also $1), but renewal for the free domain costs $12. So at renewal time, I recommend deleting the domain and re-registering it.

The largest hosting provider on TG, 50KVM, has gone bankrupt! VPSs originally priced at over 100 or 200 yuan are now all 2 yuan! All for 2 yuan! (Not really)

## The Beginning

- On Sunday, April 1st around midnight, lying in bed watching the latest episode of "National Team"
- Telegram notification pops up: 50KVM released an April Fools' discount:

![Totally baffled][2]

- Since I finished watching "National Team," might as well try entering these emojis

## First Attempt

- Tried inputting emojis using macOS input method – turned out impractical since I couldn't recognize what these emojis were
- Googled "emoji list"
- Found an emoji reference site [Emoji List][3]
- Wait, macOS emojis look completely different from those in the image
- Took some guesses
- (After 5 attempts)
- Still need to identify the emoji font. Though it's 2 AM with few people online, any delay might let other experts snatch it

## Second Attempt

- Considered what system Diaoji (50KVM owner) might use
- macOS (and iOS) already ruled out
- Picked up nearby Android phone: emojis looked different – eliminated
- Besides, hosting providers wouldn't post discount codes via mobile screenshots, right?
- Scrolled through TG group and found 50VZ's discount code image (same owner for both companies)

- ClearType artifacts visible – must be Windows 10
- Got out of bed and opened Windows 10 gaming laptop, checked emoji reference site – perfect match
- Entered each corresponding emoji, submitted code
- "The discount code you entered does not exist"
- Closely examined code input field vs. previous screenshots – something felt off?
- (Input field screenshot taken later on macOS – mentally replace the font)

- Why such wide spacing between emojis in 50KVM's screenshot?
- Added spaces?
- Entered "⛵️ ⛴ ⛅️ ⛈ ⛱ ⛄️ ⚽️ ⚾️ ⛳️ ⛸ ⛏ ⛓ ⛔️ ⭕️"
- Added spaces between each emoji pair, submitted
- "Discount code applied"

![Clapping][7]

## Bragging on Telegram

- Submitted order, logged in, checked out, took screenshot, opened TG – saw experts still trying
- "I've already claimed 50kvm's 99off discount"

- An expert: "Post it! Post it!"

- Scrolled through chat history

- "Earlier an expert entered all emojis correctly but didn't notice the spaces between them"

## Afterword

- The VPS got activated today, so I'm posting this now – no regrets (wink
- Originally chose Hong Kong Shatin traffic type Tier 3: 4GB RAM, 6 cores, original price 217.6 RMB/month, discounted to 2.18 yuan
- Owner said Tier 3 was OOS, downgraded me to Tier 2: 2GB RAM, 4 cores, original price 108.8/month
- Price unchanged (still 2.18/month) – still insanely good value (practically free)
- Topped up account with 100 yuan and renewed for 32 months until 2021 New Year
- Heirloom server acquired✓

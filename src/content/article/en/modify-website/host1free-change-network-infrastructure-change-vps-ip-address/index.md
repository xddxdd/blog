    Dear Host1Free User Lan Tian,

        We would like to announce that due to changes in our network infrastructure we will be changing current IP address of your free VPS server 5.175.206.68 to the new one 5.175.156.249.

        In order to allow you to prepare for this event we added IP address 5.175.206.68 as main IP address and old 5.175.156.249 IP left as additional to your free VPS server.
        Next Wednesday (2013-06-13) old IP address will be removed.

        Please make sure to update your servers settings, DNS settings and etc. accordingly to avoid any inconience after old IP(5.175.156.249) address removal at Wednesday."

        Please accept our apologies for the inconvenience.

    Regards,
    Host1Free adminsitrators team

In short, the VPS IP address has been changed to 5.175.206.68, while the original 5.175.156.249 will remain until next Wednesday as a transition period. Please update your DNS settings accordingly.

However, it's impressive that a permanently free VPS has remained this stable (?) for so long.

An introduction to GetIPIntel can be found in [this recent article](/en/article/modify-website/getipintel-anti-fraud.lantian).

I've developed a Typecho plugin that blocks visitors using proxies from commenting or sends their comments directly to the spam bin.

Features:

1. Multiple mode options (Blacklist only, Quick Check, Full Check)
2. Various handling measures (Manual review, Send to spam bin, Submission failure)
3. Custom threshold

The plugin can be downloaded at  
[https://github.com/xddxdd/typecho-getipintel](https://github.com/xddxdd/typecho-getipintel).  
Simply place the GetIPIntel folder into the usr/plugins directory.
```

Eight months ago, [Host1Free cleaned up a large number of idle users by shutting down their VPSes](/en/article/modify-website/host1free-check-users-vps-actively-used.lantian).  
Now, H1F has introduced another tough measure: requiring users to enter a verification code monthly to renew their service, or risk VPS deletion.

Two weeks after each renewal, you'll receive an email for the next month's renewal. You must complete the renewal within two weeks of receiving the email, otherwise your VPS will be suspended. If you fail to renew within an additional week, your data will be permanently deleted.

Additionally, this notification email was once again found in the spam folder...

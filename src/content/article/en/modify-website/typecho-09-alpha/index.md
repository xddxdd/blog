Yesterday afternoon, I got home and opened Feedly, and saw an article about Typecho 0.9 on [Jiang's Blog](http://www.zntec.cn/archives/typecho-0-9.html).

What? Typecho actually updated in my lifetime!? I immediately opened the [Typecho Official Website](http://typecho.org) and saw that clean default theme of TE. I remember the official site didn't look like this before.

The post started with just one sentence: "Yes, you haven't entered the wrong website. This simple place is indeed the official website of Typecho."...

So I immediately downloaded, updated, and installed.

The update method is simple: log in to FTP, delete the `admin` and `var` directories and `index.php`, upload these files from version 0.9, and then update the database in the backend.

When I opened the login page, I instantly felt it was high-end, grand, and classy.

It's said that TE 0.9 added a Markdown editor, which can be enabled in the personal panel. Even though I won't use it, I still took a look. The personal panel is also high-end, grand, and classy.

Article editing interface. It somewhat resembles WordPress.

HTML5 image upload, finally saying goodbye to Flash. It even supports drag and drop.

Anyway, after a year, TE finally made a move. Next, we just wait for TE to be perfected.

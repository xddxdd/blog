Attached cancellation email content:

> As of February 3, 2020, regular visa services at the U.S Embassy in Beijing
> and the U.S. Consulates General in Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenyang
> are suspended. As a result, the United States Embassy and Consulates in China
> are cancelling immigrant and non-immigrant visa appointments for June 29
> through July 10. Due to the ongoing situation relating to the novel
> coronavirus, the U.S. Embassy and Consulates have very limited staffing and
> may be unable to respond to requests regarding regular visa services. While
> some limited emergency appointments may be available, intending applicants
> should note that on Sunday, February 2, a Presidential Proclamation was issued
> that suspended entry for individuals who have been in China, excluding the
> Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau, less than 14 days prior
> to their arrival in the U.S. More information about the Proclamation can be
> found on our website here:
> https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/Presidential-Proclamation-Coronavirus.html.
> If during this period you have urgent travel that you believe may qualify for
> an exemption under the proclamation, please go to
> https://ustraveldocs.com/cn/index.html to submit an emergency appointment
> request. Please note if your urgent travel does not qualify under an
> exemption, your request will be denied until the proclamation is rescinded.

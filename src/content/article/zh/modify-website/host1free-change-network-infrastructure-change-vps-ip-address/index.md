    Dear Host1Free User Lan Tian,

        We would like to announce that due to changes in our network infrastructure we will be changing current IP address of your free VPS server 5.175.206.68 to the new one 5.175.156.249.

        In order to allow you to prepare for this event we added IP address 5.175.206.68 as main IP address and old 5.175.156.249 IP left as additional to your free VPS server.
        Next Wednesday (2013-06-13) old IP address will be removed.

        Please make sure to update your servers settings, DNS settings and etc. accordingly to avoid any inconience after old IP(5.175.156.249) address removal at Wednesday."

        Please accept our apologies for the inconvenience.

    Regards,
    Host1Free adminsitrators team

简洁来说，VPS的IP地址改成5.175.206.68，原来的5.175.156.249留到下周三作为过渡，请
修改好自己的DNS解析。

不过永久免费的VPS撑到现在还这么稳定（？）真强悍。
